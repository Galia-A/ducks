# Ducks

## About

This project was an exercise in MVC architecture, programming to interfaces, and design patterns.

## Compiling

In order to compile the game, you need the GreenSock library for AS3, which can be found [here](https://github.com/greensock/GreenSock-AS3).

## Playing

To play the game right away, download the `Game.swf` file in the `bin` directory and run it using a stand-alone Flash player, which can be found [here](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html).
